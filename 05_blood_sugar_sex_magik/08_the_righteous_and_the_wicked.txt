The Righteous & The Wicked

I can't rest in war
Will you be my friend?
Dark ages never change
Well, I can't comprehend

Kiss me, we self destruct
Can you hear me, Lord?
Yes, I think we're f*cked
But I can't rest in war

Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace

The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees

I am playing for a better day
Playing for a better day, anyway
Oh yeah, I'm playing for a better day

Holy Mother Earth
Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face
I thought she had been raped

Killing your future blood
Fill her with disease
Global abortion pleas
That is what she needs

Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace

The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees

And I am playing for a better day
Oh yeah, playing for a better day
Anyway

Are we fire flies
Flashing in the night?
Big thunder rumble fish
But did you get it right?

Headstrong 'bout this song
Exploding souls, be gone
Marvin Gaye, my love
Where did we go wrong?

Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace

The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees

Well, I am playing for a better day
