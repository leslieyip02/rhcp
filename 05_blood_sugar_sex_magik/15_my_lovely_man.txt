My Lovely Man

I used to shout across the room to you
And you'd come dancin' like a fool
Shuffle step, you funky mother
Come to me, all warm as covers

Rest with me, my lovely brother
For you, see, there is no other
Memory, so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon, save me a seat

Well, I'm cryin' now, my lovely man
Yes, I'm cryin' now and no one can
Well, ever fill the, the hole you left, my man
I'll see you later, my lovely man, if I can

In my room I'm all alone
Waiting for you to get home
Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

Well, I'm cryin' now, my lovely man
I'll see you later, my lovely man if I can

Just in case you never knew
I miss you, Slim, I love you too
See my heart, it's black and blue
When I die, I will find you

Well, I'm cryin' now, my lovely man
Yes, I'm cryin' now and no one can
Well, ever fill the, the hole you left my man
I'll see you later, my lovely man if I can

Well, I'm cryin', my lovely man
Well, I'm cryin', my lovely
[Incomprehensible] my lovely man
I'll see you later, my lovely man
We have some good time, my lovely man
