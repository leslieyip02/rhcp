Suck My Kiss

Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Hit me

Should have been, could have been
Would have been dead
If I didn't get a message
Goin' through my head

I am what I am
Most motherf*ckers
Don't give a damn
Aw, baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo peep
Comin' from my stun gun

Beware, take care
Most motherf*ckers
Have a cold ass stare
Aw baby please be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

Hit me, you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me
Stick with this

Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss

Look at me, can't you see?
All I really want to be
Is free from a world
That hurts me

I need relief
Do you want me girl
To be your thief
Aw, baby just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to

K, I, S, S, I, N, G
Chicka chicka dee
Do me like a banshee
Low brow is how

Swimming in the sound
Of bow, wow, wow
Aw, baby do me now
Do me here I do allow

Hit me, you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me
Stick with this

Is she gonna curtsy?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
That mouth was made to

Should have been, could have been
Would have been dead
If I didn't get the message
Goin' through my head

I am what I am
Most motherf*ckers
Don't give a damn
Aw, baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo peep
Comin' from my stun gun

Beware, take care
Most motherf*ckers
Have a cold ass stare
Aw, baby please be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

Hit me, you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me
Stick with this

Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
That mouth was made to suck my kiss
