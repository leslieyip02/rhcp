Get Up and Jump

A get up and jump, a get up and jump
A get up, get up, get up and jump
A jump on up, a jump on down
Just jump a jump a jump a jump a jump around
Jump the day away, jump all over town
'Cos jumpin' is okay in a jumpin' kinda way, hey

Jump a boy, jump a girl
Jump a rope, jump for joy
Just don't stop jumpin'
Keep your heart muscle pumpin'
Hillel be jumpin' on that little baby frump kin

(Say what)
You got a pumpkin in your pants?

When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs gettin' a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumpin' foos, jump you

Jump a nun, jump a jack
Jump for fun, jump back
How's about us jumpin' in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack

Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump

Jama boba, jima boba, slima boba boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Lookin' like you're mighty silly

(Say what)
You got a pumpkin in your pants?
(Say what)
You got a pumpkin in your pants?

Mister Mexican jumpin' bean knows
His fun is skeaky clean
Christ, how'd ya think that he got so clean?
Not from sittin' on his goddamn spleen, get up

Oh, I be jumpin' I be jumpin' I be jumpin' alone
I be jumpin' for the phone
I be jumpin' Mrs Jones
I really wanna jump on Kinski's bones

Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump

Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up and jump, get up and jump

Jama boba, jima boba, slima boba boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Lookin' like you're mighty silly

(Say what)
You got a pumpkin in your pants?
