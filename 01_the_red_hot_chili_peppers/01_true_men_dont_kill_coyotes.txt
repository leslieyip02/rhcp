True Men Don't Kill Coyotes

Hoo, Lord

Well, I'm gonna ride a saber tooth horse
Through the Hollywood Hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel

Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood Hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood Hills

Well, I'm gonna ride a saber tooth horse
Through the Hollywood Hills
Just don't show me anything
'Cause that's the way I feel

Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood Hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood Hills

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood an' blood never lies
Pale face die

True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't kill coyotes

Well, I'm gonna ride a saber tooth horse
Through the Hollywood Hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel

Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood Hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood Hills

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood an' blood never lies
Pale face die

True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't

Well, I'm gonna ride a saber tooth horse
Through the Hollywood Hills
Just don't tell me anything
'Cause that's the way I feel

Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood Hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood Hills

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood an' blood never lies
Pale face die

True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't

True men don't kill coyotes
