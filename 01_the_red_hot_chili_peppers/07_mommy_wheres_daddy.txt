Mommy, Where's Daddy?

Mommy, where's daddy?
Mommy, where's daddy?
Right here, girl

Oh, sweet thing, you look so sad
Cheer up, don't you know your dad is bad
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad

Well, there ain't no problem, I can't face
[Incomprehensible], your daddy's got a bigger bag of tricks
Come, give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad

Mommy, where's daddy?
Mommy, where's daddy?

Come on, sit on your daddy's lap
'Cause I'm the one who pats your back
Come, give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad

Well, lemme see now where to begin
Well, lemme start by tuckin' you in
Come, give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad

Mommy, where's daddy?
