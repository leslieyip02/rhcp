Why Don't You Love Me

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothing's like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Oh, why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me?
Somebody changed, so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't know why
We don't get near or further, closer, land of country mouths
I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't know why
We don't get near or further, closer, land of country mouths, take the ball

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothing's like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Oh, why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me?
Somebody changed, so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't know why
We don't get near or further, closer, land of country mouths
