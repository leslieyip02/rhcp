One Hot Minute

I was riding, riding on my bike
Me with my friend we're so alike
Am I all alone

She said all we have is this
We just had to stop and share a kiss
Am I all alone

One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it

If I chase it I might waste it
Come and spit it
Am I all alone, am I all alone

Sitting in the fire, I get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher, oh, maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier, I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun, sitting in the fire

Close your eyes and click your heels
Can you believe how good it feels
Am I all alone

One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it

If I chase it I might waste it
Come and spit it
Am I all alone, am I all alone

Sitting in the fire, I get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher, oh, maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier, I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun, sitting in the fire

[Incomprehensible]

Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done

Sitting in the fire, I get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher, oh, maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier, I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun, sitting in the fire
