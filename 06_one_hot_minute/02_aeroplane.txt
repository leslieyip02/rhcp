Aeroplane

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane
Songbird, sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherf*ckers always spiked with pain

Looking in my own eyes, hey, Lord
I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose

Looking in my rear view mirror
Looking in my rear view mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear, have no fear

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane
Songbird, sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherf*ckers always spiked with pain

Sitting in my kitchen, hey, girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby, the star of mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me

I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad, sad like me

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane
Songbird, sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain

Just one note could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from the song she wrote
Could f*ck me where I lay

Just one note could make me choke
One note that's not a lie
Just one note could cut my throat
One note could make me die

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane
Songbird, sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane

That's spiked with pain
