Stretch You Out

Stretching out your tightness
Good enough this shit to grow
We are rolling favor for this motion
Stretching out your tightness
Time to open up your whole
When it rains, i let myself get wet
I have always wanted to
Give something to my brother
Proposing to expose your head
To something that is like no other
Hit it
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out my friend
I'll stretch you out
The acoustic goes from intuition is my liquid fare
We are all in favor of the opening
Three pounds of love and knowledge are expanding in my skull
Truth be told, we let the good times roll
I have always needed to
Receive it and believe it
And its expanding and creating love
Tender titilations
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out my friend
I'll stretch you out
I'm a fish and i can swim all day
I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as i go along
That way it is never wrong
I'm a bird and i can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as i go along
That way it is never wrong
Ooooooooow
There's a glowing up around the moon it's showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing
Very legendary instraplanetary fairy
Varied truths
She's making just for you
Yes, i have always wanted to
Give something to this stranger
M m m moving to approve the groove
A mental transformation
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out my friend
I'll stretch you out
