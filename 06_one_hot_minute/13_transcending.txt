Transcending

You are my God, you are my dog
You kept me close, love never lost
I called you hippie, you said, "F*ck off"
Said your brother's a real punk rocker

Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me, Lord, over the moon

Friends near death you gave respect
Sympathetic intellect
Choices are for one and all
All we are is leaves that fall

That's all

Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you

Round and round inside your head
Smartest f*cker, I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul

Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me, Lord, over the moon

Mule donkey ass you bore a load
Of all creations tortured souls
Choices are for one and all
All we are is leaves that fall

Like no other, I love you your my brother
Like no other, I love you your my brother
Like no other, I love you your my brother
Like no other, I love you your my brother
Like no other, I love you your my brother
Like no other, I love you your my brother

Water flowing and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood, will never be understood

Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me in a loving stream
Hey mother May, I have lost a child
But she gave birth to a loving stream

Ooh, never know
When the Gods will come and take you to a loving stream
Ooh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me were from your loving stream

In a loving stream

F*ck the magazines
F*ck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream

F*ck the legal greed
F*ck the nothing scene
See the family
In the loving stream
