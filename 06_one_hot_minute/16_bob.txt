Bob

Well, my friend Bob's in jail today
His girlfriend is too
For stealing change for gasoline

Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the prude (???)
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no

I met him on the boulevard, Hollywood and Vine
He said "you're gonna be a superstar"
I said "that's fine, sublime"
He loved my crime

But there will never be another one just like you, no

I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

Hanking laid all thru the night
Blackest flag at dawn
A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong, that's wrong
Please be life long

'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no

I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

Killing yourself, that would be an awesome oath (???)
This song is so far away (???)
Remember the home and now they left us alone (???)
Remember our friend

Stealing everything in the store
You know I want you to stay
Remember the home and now they left us alone (???)
Friends fade away,

Well, my friend Bob's insane today
I know I am too
A mental patient's laugh and cry

Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the prude (???)
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
