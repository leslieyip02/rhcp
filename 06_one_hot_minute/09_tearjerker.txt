Tearjerker

My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth
Would not be true
Refuse the news

I'm feeling sick now
What the f*ck am I
Supposed to do
Just loose and loose

First time I saw you
You were sitting
Backstage in a dress
A perfect mess

You never knew this
But I wanted
Badly for you to
Requite my love

Left on the floor, leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way so hard to stay
Guess now you know I love you so

I liked your whiskers
And I liked the
Dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes

You painted pictures
'Cause the one that hurts
Can give so much
You gave me such

Left on the floor, leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way so hard to stay
Guess now you know I love you so
