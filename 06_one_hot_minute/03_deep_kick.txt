Deep Kick

It started when we were little kids
Free spirits but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents, we got together
And wrote on desks and slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains

And slipped through whatever cracks we can find
Minds altered, we didn't falter
In portraying hysterical and tragic characters
In a smog filled universe

We loved the dirty city and the journeys away from it
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spiral
Leaving trail of irretrievable vital life juice behind

Still the brothers blood comrades partner family cuss
Was impenetrable and we lived inside it laughing with no clothes
And everything experimental 'til death was upon us
In our face mortality and lots of things seemed futile then

But love and music can save us and did
While the giant gray monster grew more poisoned and volatile around us
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around
Nothing is the same so we keep moving, we keep moving

Went off and got some hair cuts
Looking wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a the transvestite

Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in another bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
Motherf*ckers woke us up

Two young brothers on a hover craft
Telepathics, love and belly laughs

Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk box go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless

Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no, no

Two young brothers on a hover craft
Telepathics, love and belly laughs

Oh shit
Oh shit

We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down, grease at Canters
Run like hell they can't catch us

Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealin' anything that we could
Gotta sneak into the Starwood
Gotta peak into the deep good

I remember ten years ago
In Hollywood, we did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the Butthole Surfers said it's better to regret
Something you did than something you didn't do

We were young and we were looking
Looking, looking for the deep kick
Seen 'em come, seen 'em go
