Warped

My tendency for dependency
Is offending me, it's upending me
I'm pretending, see, to be strong and free
From my dependency, it's warping me

So much love, so rare to dare
Afraid of ever being there
Take me home, I need repair
Take me please to anywhere

Descend all the way, all the way

Descended from demented men
Struggle with the art of Zen
Please don't look too close at me
You might not like what you see

Descend all the way, all the way
Everyday warped and scared
Of being there, of being there

Night craving sends me crawling
Beg for mercy, does it show?
A vacancy that's full of holes
Hold me please, I'm feeling cold

Descend all the way, all the way
Everyday warped and scared
Of being there, of being there
