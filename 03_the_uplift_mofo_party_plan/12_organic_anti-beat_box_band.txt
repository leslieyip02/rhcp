Organic Anti-Beat Box Band

Welcome friends to my thoughts of when
the fax city 4 were four young men
time has come, now we jam
with the uplift mofo party plan
we're the organic anti-beat box band

One comes from the holy land
another was born an australian
me i'm from michigan
but hollywood is the land of lands
it's a hollywood jam

We represent the hollywood kids
hollywood is where we live
we represent the hollywood kids
organic anti-beat box band

Life is grand in the land of lands
the mind does boggle the mind expands
the anarchy 4 have manned their craft
get on your knees and shake your ass
to the jam that is

We don't ask we demand
that you and your clan
listem now to this jam
to the power of the drummers bad
it's a hollywood jam

We represent the hollywood kids
hollywood is where we live
we represent the hollywood kids
organic anti-beat box band

There's a party in my town at 12:00
there's a party that's rockin down to the rock
I've got nothin' against hip hop
but there's a party in my town
and no beat box jam that is

The party's got girls the girls got hot
the party's got boys and the boys got socks
something popped the doors unlocked
house got up ran around the block
sit down house
take off your blouse

We represent the hollywood kids
hollywood is where we live
any good friend of the lollypop kids
over the rainbow with the wiz
we represent the hollywood kids
organic anti-beat box band

With the organic anti-beat box band
you just might slam dance that is
it's a hollywood jam
