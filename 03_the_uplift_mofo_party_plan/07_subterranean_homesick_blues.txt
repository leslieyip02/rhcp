Subterranean Homesick Blues

Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off, pay him off

God knows when but you're doin' it again!
You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten, so look out, kid

Look out, kid, because it's something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, lookout

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May orders from the D.A. the double D.A

Walk on your tip toes, don't try, no doz
You better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, and an eye on the plain clothes
â€~Cause you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Look out, kid

Look out, kid, because it's something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid

Looks to me like you did a little to much hittin' kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid. look out, kid

The good God willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chillin'em, thrillin' 'em, and red hot killin'em
Killin' 'em, I said killin' 'em, come on, come on
Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well

Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, jump back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail

But users, cheaters, six time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters look out, kid

Look out, kid, because it's something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Look out, kid, because it's something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep it all hid, lookout
