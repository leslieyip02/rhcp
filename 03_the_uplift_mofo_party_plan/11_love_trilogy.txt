Love Trilogy

My love comes and when it does
It's a crazy kind of selective affection
My love flows like a wise guy's tie
In the zaniest of directions

My love protection, my love erection
You better get some of my infection
My love can be a bigger than the Hoover Dam
My love can hide behind a grain of sand

My love for life is fueled by the love for my band
I love his mother and the silly mixed up man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh and ask my dad

My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is the deepest depth, the ocean blues
My love is the Zulu groove
My love is the coop-a-loop move

My love is lightning's blues
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is gettin' skin on my fluke
My love, my love

My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for a fresh set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums

My love for a bunch of knuckleheads
My love for the sweet smell of bread
My love for the legs that I spread
My love for the fat natty dread
My love, my love

My love is my toes in the sand
My love is my dick in my head
My love is my toes in the sand
My love is my dick in my head
