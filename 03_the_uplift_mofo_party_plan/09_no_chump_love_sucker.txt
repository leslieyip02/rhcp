No Chump Love Sucker

She's a witch, a bat
A bona fide bore
What's more, she snores
And that is a fact

Cow eyes lie
Yes, it's time to resist
How did I ever
Get into this?

How could I ever
Have kissed that bitch
So what if she
Has got big tits

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind real quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit

She came like a cat
Like a cat to cat nip
She came in my life
With her womanly hips

When I first met her
I came unglued
Well, I played the part
Of a blue blooded fool

I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that
I'd get the last laugh

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind real quick
She's the kinda girl
Who won't just let things sit

Like two trains on one track
And bound for a crash
Two red white and blues
We were destined to clash

I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
Like fly by night news
We were not meant to last

I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with
By you and your whack attack

Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no, no, no, no
I'm no chump love sucker

No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker

I thought that your love
Was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride
When I realized that

The smack in my bag
And my baseball bat
Was all you were after
You dirty rat

A bitch and a brat
And a living disaster
She thought she was fast
But I was faster

No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker

No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
