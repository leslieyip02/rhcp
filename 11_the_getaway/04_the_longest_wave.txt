The Longest Wave

Throw me all around
Like a boomerang sky
Whatever you do
Don't tell me why
Poppies grow tall
Then say bye bye
The wave is here

A seamless little team
And then we tanked
I guess we're not so sacrosanct
The tip of my tongue
But then we blanked
The wave is here
Waiting on the wind
To tell my side

Ready set jet
But she never gets far
Listen to your skin
From the seat of my car
Two centipedes stuck
In one glass jar
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To tell my side

Whatcha want?
Whatcha need?
Do you love?

Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day

Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came

Sterile as the barrel
Of an old 12 gauge
Under my skin
And half my age
Hotter than the wax
On a saxifrage
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To turn my page

Steady your sails
For the butterfly flap
Whatever you do
Don't close that gap
I'm dreaming of a woman
But she's just my nap
Your ship is in
Waiting on the tide so I can swim

Whatcha want
Whatcha need
Do you love

Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day

Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came

Now I know why we came
Now I know
