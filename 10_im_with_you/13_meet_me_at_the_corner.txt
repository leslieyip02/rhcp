Meet Me at the Corner

Please don't ask me who, who you think I am,
I could live without that, I'm just a modest man.
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do.

Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now,
I'm guessing we're through now,
Proceeding into the forest, I will lay around and wait,
And I'll wait for you.

Please don't ask me where, where you think I've been,
I've been a lot of places but this could be my win.
Meet me at the corner where I'll, tell me what to do.
Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now,
I'm guessing we're through now,
Proceeding into the forest, I will lay around and wait,
And I'll wait for you.

I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know,
I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know,
Something I wanna show, I thought you'd wanna know.

Please don't say you want to keep in touch,
I bare to see you on the corner, that I just can't bare.
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do.

Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now,
I'm guessing we're through now,
Proceeding into the forest, I will lay around and wait,
And I'll wait for you.

And I turn, I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the gods,
A sign from the gods that you were meant to be mine, and it's fine,
Taking it all for a ride til the day when it's gone,
I mystified my way, it all went wrong when it's gone,
I live and I learn and I lose and I win, but it's better whenever,
Whenever I'm here, thank you girl for everywhere that I've been.
