(C'mon c'mon)

Verse 1:
I'm comin for you cause cause I adore you and
I'd like to get inside your mastroduction
This indecision has has got me cringin well
I can't resist the smell of your seduction
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go
Unwrap the package with a mutt persuasion
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go
I wanna dance to every day's occasion

(Chorus):
This I know, yeah this I know! (Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we not alone! (Take me home, take me home)

Verse 2:
When we invision, lack of division and
The planet does another revolution
The day I blew on ya you said I grew on ya
Turns out that we are all the one solution
GO!
