Police Station

I saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say.
Your eyes had wandered off to something distant, cold and grey.
I guess you didn't see it coming,
Someone's gotten used to slumming.
Dreaming of the golden years,
I see you had to change careers.
Far away, but we both know it's somewhere.

I saw you on the back page of some pre press yesterday.
The drip wood in your eyes had nothing short of love for pain.
I know you from another picture,
Of someone with the most convictions.
We used to read the funny papers,
Fooled around and pulled some capers.
Not today, send a message to her.
A message that I'm coming, coming to pursue her.

Tell your country I, rest my face on your bed.
I've got you ten times over, I'll chase you down 'til you're dead.
I saw you on a TV station and it made me wanna pray.
An empty shell of loveliness is now dusted with decay.
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker.
Someone oughta situate her,
Find a way to educate her.
All the way, time to come and find you.
You can't hide from me girl, so never mind what I do.

Tell your country I, rest my face on your bed.
I bet my sovereign country and I, left it all for your head.

I saw you in the church and there was no time to exchange.
You were getting married and it felt so very strange.
I guess I didn't see it coming,
Now I guess it's me who's bumming.
Dreaming of the golden years,
You and I were mixing tears.
Not today, not for me but someone.
I never could get used to, so now I will refuse to.

Tell your country I, rest my face on your bed.
I bet my sovereign country and I, left it all for your head

I got my best foot forward and I'll chase you down 'til you're dead
