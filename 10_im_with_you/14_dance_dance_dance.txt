Dance, Dance, Dance

You got yours and I got mine
She got his and she got shine
Under moon and overseas
She got those and we got these
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
We got strong, as we got strong
We say hello, it's safe to go
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
We got strong, as we got strong
The light is right,
Let's play tonight,
Let's play
Give yourself a chance to find a way
The holiness appeared is here to stay
They got this and we got there
He got his and she got bad
You got mine and I got yours
I got love but you got more
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
All night long, it's all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
We got strong, as we got strong
We say hello, it's safe to go
Let's play
Give yourself a chance to find a way
The holiness appeared is here to stay
Tell your mom and dad it's all okay
The holiness appears, it's here to stay
I got another one, I got another one,
I got another one, I got another one,
Whoa, I got another one
You got yours and I got mine
He got his and she got shine
We got all but she got high
Some got hot and then gone by
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
We got strong, as we got strong
We say hello, it's safe to go
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
We got strong, as we got strong
The light is right,
Let's play tonight,
Let's make the ride,
The summer thrives,
Let's play,
Let's play.
