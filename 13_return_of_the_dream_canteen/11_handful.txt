Handful

I wanna splash some water all over my face
I'll stick and move, you know I don't feel no disgrace
I'll take it all off so everyone can see
The damage that I am, all the troubles that I be

Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older, yeah

There's a chapter in my book that I don't want you read
There's a chapter in my life where I failed to succeed
I wanna take your smell inside my dirty mind

Someone to love for the rest of your days

You can shoot 'em all down so they won't steal my dream

Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older

Someone to love for the rest of your days
Out on the road
Sky turns to water and night into days
Someone to hold

I wanna splash a little love on your face
You fill me right up while you put me in my place

And god only goes to the places that we need

Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older
Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time
