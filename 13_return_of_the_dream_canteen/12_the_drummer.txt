The Drummer

Stay away
Fall asleep
Take a look at what you think and what you really need to keep
My atoms are indivisible

Shut it up
Run it down
Live a life that's underground, a heated love that's not allowed
A Dum Dum Club is inadmissible

Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore

Walk it back
Get the knack
Information to unpack, a guitar in a gunny sack
My best move is in the criminal

Let's make a wish as we enter thе lift
'Cause the system's a rеlative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore

Let's move like the Chapatula do
I'd be down to wallow in New Orleans
See-through sunrise on the Waterloo
Slits are rather fancy when they're forming, I do

Better days
On the way
Flowing like a manta ray, the Dodgers made a double play
My dance moves are sub-subliminal

Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore, oh

Listen to my one request
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore
