Reach Out

Drop another snake bomb it might shake
I confused it
With an earthquake
Mass confusion in a mason jar

Texas blood flow
In a biker bar
Stick to bluegrass guns
We are riding

With the flying nuns
Tell me all the dirty things you have seen
Are you laced up?
Well, are you really clean?

I'ma lose it if I do not find
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

I'ma bruiser and I do not mind
Someone better reach out
Climb a mountain time
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

Cruising down the hill in a blue streetcar
Can't refuse it
No matter who you are
Filling up your head with a bathtub rose

We composed it
But does it really show?
Slow your donkeys down
This good lord is

From a border town
I'm about to lose what little I've got
Please don't treat me
Like an afterthought

I'ma lose it if I do not find
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

I'ma bruiser and I do not mind
Someone better reach out
Climb a mountain time
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

Feel my call the lexicon makes its
Own way, own way
Break this fall, the excellence has it's
Own say, own say

Hazard pay for a canceled bear
Bygone Sally
With the greasy hair
Hard as nails but soft to wear

Rooftop crops up
And a folding chair
Pay your thug store hench
Mugshot daddy

With the golden wrench
Locomotive smoke to cover up what's broke
Please don't seize me
Until you get my joke

I'ma lose it if I do not find
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

I'ma bruiser and I do not mind
Someone better reach out
Climb a mountain time
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

I'ma lose it if I do not find
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line
