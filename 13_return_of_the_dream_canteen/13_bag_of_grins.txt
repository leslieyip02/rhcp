Bag Of Grins

In my day I could hear them say
Mr. K was awfully close
Now we take that bow you know
'Cause it's time to meet your ghost
And I don't understand

Minotaurs and jaguars
Are at my finger's tip
Falling up through the mustard gates
And I think I broke my hip
And I don't understand
I do not understand

Nine o'clock I turn my heels and sigh
For one last time
10:30 I tied my chi
And died up on the vine

Send me out to the pasture, love
With a closet full of whips
The coroner spins with his bag of grins
And he's sewing up my lips
And I don't understand

Nine o'clock I turn my heels and sigh
For one last time
10:30 I tied my chi
And died up on the vine
I died up on the vinе

Suddenly when the momеnt comes
And it's harmony or rage
Flowers cry on the corpse of love
And it's time to turn your page

Mr. and Mrs. Au Contraire
I think they'll soon arrive
All the treasures you have saved
Your children now divide
And I don't understand
I do not understand

Nine o'clock I turn my heels and-

Suddenly when the moment comes
And it's harmony or rage
Flowers cry on the corpse of love
And it's time to turn your page

I am somewhere else my love
And I think you'll know just where to find me
Out in an interstellar place and there's
Nothing left here to define me

You are somewhere else good love
And this life of crime that's all behind me
We are all just space and love
And I think you'll know that's who designed me, yeah

I am somewhere else my love
And I think you'll know just where to find me
Out in an interstellar place and there's
Nothing left here to define me

You are somewhere else good love
And this life of crime that's all behind me
We are all just space and love
And I think you'll know that's who designed
Me
