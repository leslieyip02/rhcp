The Shape I'm Takin'

You wanna beat it, but you're never gonna leave this town
In the jungle with a fever comes immediate crown
I'm alone with all my friends, fireworks in a pussy den

Shakin' up that new West End, don't get too close, my style bends
I'ma do my thing this time, Hudson River serpentine
Everything we overheard, pizza's free on thirty-third and third, third, third

Don't you love me, baby? The shape I'm takin'
At the Latin quarter, trouble funk is on the floor, oh, my children
Don't you love me, baby? The shape I'm takin'
Jungle at the disco, jungle's what they came here for

The beat is tricky, but you're never gonna move it around
You're dressin' up when you really should be dressin' down
Gettin' on my one last nerve, ring my bell on Dead Man's Curve

Pick it up, Jamaica, Queens, that super walk is so obscene
Gonna do your thing this time, East Side River, box of wine
Throw it up, it's time to serve, pizza's free on thirty-third and third, third, third

Don't you love me, baby? The shape I'm takin'
At the Latin quarter, trouble funk is on the floor, oh, my children
Don't you love me, baby? The shape I'm takin'
Jungle at the disco, jungle's what they came here for

You wanna beat it, but you're never gonna leave this town
You're dressin' up, you really should be dressin' down
In the jungle, fever comes immediate crown

Don't you love me, baby? The shape I'm takin'
At the Latin quarter, trouble funk is on the floor, oh, my children
Don't you love me, baby? The shape I'm takin'
Jungle at the disco, jungle's what they came here for
