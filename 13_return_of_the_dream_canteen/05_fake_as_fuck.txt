Fake As Fuck

Listening to the great beyond
Where misdirection waves its magic wand
Everybody sing that song
Tuesday morning comes along, I read the news, it's all gone wrong
The facts of life have left too soon, the serving up doom and gloom

Never gonna leave my room
Black Capricorn will blow the horn
For all the love that can't be born today
Everybody walk away

Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And take me to your leader where the makeup
Is fake as f*ck
Strap it on in to map it on out

Spin Doctors wanna makе you think it's straight up
Just out of luck
Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And takе me to your leader where the makeup

Is fake as f*ck
Strap it on in to map it on out
Spin Doctors wanna make you think you're straight up
Just out of luck

Friday afternoon is cool, I lost my faith in Sunday school
Deliver me from Liverpool, I feel just like an April fool
Someone gotta break that rule
Sticking to the script, we built another sinking ship

She's so alone
Never gonna leave my home
Mother nature can't go wrong, the science god's forever strong
A-floating in a great beyond, everybody sing along
Everybody rock that song

Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And take me to your leader where the makeup
Is fake as f*ck
Strap it on in to map it on out

Spin Doctors wanna make you think you're straight up
Just out of luck
Because you're [?] yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And take me to your leader where the makeup

Is fake as f*ck
Strap it on in to map it on out
Spin Doctors wanna make you think you're straight up
Just out of luck

I'm a lonely, lonely lord
Searching all night for the wrong reward
An appetite that's running on all fours
Misdirection waves its wand

Turning my head from black to blonde
Like a queen will now become the pawn
Busted on a ship gone, take me home
Mother named faith, made lightning chrome

Busted on a ship that's sailing through the foam
I'm a lonely, lonely lord
Pick another day to be restored
Just another fate that's going overboard
