La La La La La La La La

I wanna spend my life with you
Mess around with things to do
We could start a family few
Life so hard that think we'll rue

I'll f*ck up and get so mad
Act just like my broken dad
Chris Columbus solitaire
Whistle when you want me there

Give me your honey
Well I won't spend it in one place
Bended knee to get a taste

I wanna spin my wheels with you
Win and lose some deals with you
Tell me how it feels for you
To order Happy Meals for two

And when it all seems out of reach
We'll clean up plastic off the beach
Your figure is a pеrfect speech
You'll be Chong and I'll be Cheech

Givе me your honey
Well I won't spend it in one place
Bended knee to get a taste

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Pull back the curtain
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You are that person

Indonesia, that's my groove
It doesn't matter where we move
I lost you at the Vegas Louvre
But we don't need no rings to prove

Crippled by some looping fields
The ripples of a lost career
Phone call from a financier
And no one lives like Norman Lear

Give me your honey
Well I won't spend it in one place
Bended knee to get a taste

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Pull back the curtain
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You are that person

I wanna spend my life with you
Stare at space before it's through
Every day is the same but new
Even when it's old, that's cool
