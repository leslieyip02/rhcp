Roulette

(One, two)

The college years were lean, well
Coming out but maybe not so clean, my love
And if I stay much longer
My feelings for you, they might get much stronger, now

A Motorola coma
Sleep your way into a deep diploma, girl
At the dormitory
You've come to pour me one of your best stories, girl

And I feel your face getting wet
Like the color red of roulette
And I place my losing bet
On your side

And I see your eyes of regret
But you gave as good as you get
Like a Massachusetts thrеat
Running wild

A pair of dirty jeans, well
You would wash inside my brass machinе, that's good
Laying on your mattress
A thing of beauty, we would need more practice now

Hall and Oates were singing
The funny notes that you were always bringing, girl
And elevator's closing
Hard to hide when love is so exposing

And I feel your face getting wet
Like the color red of roulette
And I place my losing bet
On your side

And I see your eyes of regret
But you gave as good as you get
Like a Massachusetts threat
Running wild

When I grow up, Villanova
Light me up when you decide
Start aroma of your Tacoma
A tiny box where we reside

A-battle tested, a life invested
Duly noted and denied
A-fully loaded, space encoded
A quiet night out in the sky

Your stack of lies was daunting
A tribute to your mind but way more haunting, now
A talking psycho killer
We'd trade the heads of even henry Miller, now

Conspiracy's a theory
I wonder, Tim, if this could be your Leary, love, ah
She act like Marlon Brando
Born on line inside the San Fernando
