My Cigarette

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
One minute, please, while I sit back and reflect
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Sip from this glass of hours
We pass like faulty towers
My sweetness, it's not weakness
Black holes wink but she devours

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Greek to me, I don't speak Latin
Island calling, must be Staten
Nat King Cole and Dick Van Patten
New York Dolls all dressed in satin

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
Just one possession in the life that we get
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Jumping Jiminy, the cat is in the chimney
Curtain call and I need some anonymity
Trip my balls, beat, lost on Wall Street
We all fall, that's my cross street

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

This business of forgiveness
Free your mind and we bare witness
Bring me windshield wiper fluid
Clean my slate so I'm not clueless

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Charming Mister Deadpan Laughter
Walking towards the things we're after
Dancing David Lee toastmaster
Take some chances, that's my rapper

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
So many daydreams that I tend to forget
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Jumping Jiminy, the cat is in the chimney
Curtain call and I need some anonymity
Smokey defect, time to reflect
My game and now we eject

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
One minute, please, while I sit back and reflect
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
Don't know how happy that a person can get
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
