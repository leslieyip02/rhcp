Porcelain

Porcelain, are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Drifting and floating and fading away

Porcelain, do you smell like a girl when you smile
Can you bear not to share with your child
Drifting and floating and fading away

Little lune all day
Little lune

Porcelain, do you carry the moon in your womb
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away

Porcelain are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Nodding and melting and fading away

Little lune all day
Little lune

Little lune all day
Little lune
