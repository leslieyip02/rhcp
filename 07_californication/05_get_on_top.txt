Hit me, come get me
I bite but she bit me

Gorilla Cuntilla
Sammy D and Salmonella
Come with me 'cause I'm an ass killer
You're ill but I'm iller

I'll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I'll knock and
Set you up to get on top

(Get on top)
Complications of a mastermind
(Get on top)
Last temptation of my kind
(Get on top)
Extra planetary sign when do we align
(Get on top)
All in time, right on

Get up and come sit up
I light but she lit up

Grass Hopper, Show Stopper
The life of a Wife Swapper
Come with me 'cause I'm a big bopper
You do but I wopper

Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws

Last temptation of my kind

Extra planetary sign when do we align
(Get on top)
All in time, right on

Hit me, come get me
Well, I bite but she bit me

Speed Baller Rhodes Scholar
Bottom Bitch and a Bottom Dollar
Come with me 'cause I'm a free faller
You hoot but I holler

I'll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I'll knock and
Set you up to get on top
