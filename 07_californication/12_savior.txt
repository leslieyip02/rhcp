Savior

Dusting off your savior
Well, you were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
To celebrate you is greater
Now that I can, always my man

Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand, all in a hand
Just like you could, you make me
All that I am, all in a hand

A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra
The more I have something to bring

And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and any damage done
Will be all right
Call out my name, call and I came

Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior
He's just a man, all in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver
Anyone can, always my man

I would never betray you
Look at me, who could raise you?
Face in the sand, safe in your hand
You were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand

We are the Red Hots
And we're loving lots the love me nots
The flowers in your flower pot
Are dancing on the table tops

And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and everything he does
Will be all right
Call out my name, call and I came

Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man
