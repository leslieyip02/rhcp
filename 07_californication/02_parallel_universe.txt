Parallel Universe

Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first
Under water where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in the sea just like me

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything

Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my a solar system that fits in your eye microcosm
You could die but you never dead spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head fields of space kid

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything
Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything

Psychic changes are born in your heart entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on salted cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am down with you

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything
Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything
