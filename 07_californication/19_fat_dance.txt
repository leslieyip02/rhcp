Fat Dance

Do a fat dance
Do a fat dance
Do a do a do a fat dance (x4)

One reason why I got you for
A-woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving cause I need the hardcore

Do a fat dance
Do a fat dance
Do a do a do a fat dance (x2)

Soft shoe or stiletto I'm a coming
I'm feeling in the ghetto 'cause that's my trouble

Do a fat dance
Do a fat dance
Do a do a do a fat dance (x4)

Another reason why I love your ass
Your dancing like everyday could be your last
Do ya do ya do ya wanna dance
Lets get it on like black trash

Do a fat dance
Do a fat dance
Do a do a do a fat dance (x2)

Soft shoe or stiletto I'm a coming
Feeling in the ghetto 'cause that's my trouble

I met her on the school yard and
She was such a cool card
She took me for a fool
Because I acted like a bodyguard
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She was just the cutest thing
My god that I have ever seen
Tearin' up my seratonin
Messin' with my dopamine
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
Just about the time
That I was feeling smart again
She walked into the room
Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She knew what she was doin'
When she told me no shoein'
In the lesson for the lesson
Man it makes for perfect screwin'
Oh Yohanna love oh oh

Do a fat dance
Do a fat dance
Do a do a do a fat dance (x2)

Number three reason why I'm in your house
Hot butter melts across your mouth
Dancing and a dancing, and a dancing machine
Somebody move, somebody scream

Yeah

First reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the move-a-more
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving â€˜cause I need the hardcore
I need the hardcore
I need the hardcore
I need the hardcore
Hardcore
