Around the World

All around the world we could make time
Rompin' and a-stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the north and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whine but I must warn ya
'Bout the motherf*ckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said, "Hallelujah"
Good God girl I wish I knew ya

I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say hello, and then I say I do

Come back, baby 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world back from Bombay
Fox hole love pie in your face
Livin' in and out of a big fat suitcase

Bona fide ride step aside Mike Johnson
Yes I could in the woods of Wisconsin
A week up the cape at the lake she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say hello, and then I say I do

Where you want to go? Who you want to be?
What you want to do? Just come with me
I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me girl sittin' in the Swiss mountains

Me oh, my oh, me and guy oh
Free then a bird when we're rockin' Ohio
Around the world I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

I know, I know for sure
I know, I know it's you

Mother Russia, do not suffer I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world and I have seen your love
I know, I know it's you
You say hello, and then I say I do
