Nobody Weird Like Me

The freakiest show I know
Is the show of my own
Living my life in and out
Of the twilight zone

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

[Oh, I love ya]
[And you love me too]

Intercourse with a porpoise
Is a dream for me
Hell bent on inventing
A new species

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

[Incomprehensible]

Riding down the path
On the back of a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed
'Cause I passed some gas

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

[Incomprehensible]

Enchanted as a rabbit
That my life is a dream
Well, everything is never
Just as it seems

The freakiest show I know
Is the show of my own
Living my life in and out
Of the twilight zone

[Incomprehensible]
