Subway to Venus

Step right up and listen please
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
Well, well everybody gather 'round
All aboard the underground

You gotta get in before you get out
And getting out is what it's gonna be about
Well, if you find that you are blind
Open up your bashful mind

Let my band step inside
Take you on a cosmic ride
Let my band step inside
Take you on a cosmic ride

With honest sounds, I'll paint your brain
For in this song, I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain

Slinky as my speech may be
On this trip, you'll ride for free
And as we leave our trailer spot
Well outer space is not so dark

This axis bold as love you see
Comes and goes so easily
This axis bold as love you see
Comes and goes so easily

Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus

Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid, you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aww, be my guest inside my grove

'Cause what I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you [Incomprehensible]
Make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm

Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll

Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus

What I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you [Incomprehensible]
Make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm

Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Well take your body, shake it around
And do the dog on the ground

And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have
To make you piss your pants

Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus

Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus
Space is king or, or so I sing
Subway to Venus
