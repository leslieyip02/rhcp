Johnny, Kick A Hole in the Sky

I saw a star spangled banner yet wave

I, I, I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
God damn, what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced

Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I wonder why, why
Put us in your pumpkin shell
Where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell

When history books are full of shit
I become the anarchist, I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie, no place for me, I bleed

Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I decide to defy
Kill my trust if you must, but in my blood there is the lust
For life, that's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing through me like a shark
Crashing through the dark

Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I confide, confide
What am I supposed to do, I feel like I'm cut in two
Confused by rules
Do these two cultures clash or am I living in the past?
I ask, please, tell me fast

Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, that's right
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
Be wrong, that's wrong
I took my foot and kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead, forefathers, help me decide

A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides

Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of adaption and I've got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man
