Sexy Mexican Maid

Hair so smooth, black as coal
Baby, the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue
That you take my blues away

She comes and goes, that I know
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist, I kiss you lips
You're my sexy Mexican maid

[Incomprehensible]
Let me please get on my knees
I come alone

When I wake up in the morn
She greets me where I lay
I look outside to find
That it's a bright and sunny day

So serene, she gives to me
My toast and marmalade
What more can I say
She's my sexy Mexican maid

[Incomprehensible]
Let me please get on my knees

She puts me in a bubble bath
She tickle me and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean
Then she does a little sexy dance

Happy to feel my hand go slap
Upon her sexy ass
We make fun, so very slow
Then we make it very fast

[Incomprehensible]
Let me please get on my knees
[Incomprehensible]
