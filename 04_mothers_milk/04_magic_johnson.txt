Magic Johnson

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kinds of the court shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact

M A G I C see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M A G I C, magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams but he don't give a f*ck

Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck

Scott stops, pops and drops it in
On his way back gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named A.C. Green
Slam so hard break your TV screen

Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole make your mamma talk
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact

Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
'Cause they got more moves that a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops then cheers
A roar through the forum that deafens my ears

The one and only know if his kind sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds but for being bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar all time great super super star
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact
