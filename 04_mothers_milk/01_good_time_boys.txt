Good Time Boys

Indeed it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel 'round the world gettin' naked on the stage
Bustin' people out of their everyday cage

We like to think, we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mammy and our pappy

Funky young kings we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
Talkin' 'bout my buddy's funk it up fish bone

Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day the good time boys, might just be president

Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's gonna shatter every stone cold face

Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Makin' more than money, more than money can buy
I stop and take a listen to the monsters try

Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you don't believe me you can ask John Doe
'Cause his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you 'bout the band called Fire Hose

To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it

Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours

Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
