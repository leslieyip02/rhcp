Stone Cold Bush

She's stone cold bush yea
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush yea
And that's alright with me

Get up off your knees, come on walk with me
Tell me what you need to get along
A statue come to live I cut you with my knife
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush
Yea yea yea yea yea

Haight street got nothing to show except the skirt on your ass
When you're livin' on the streets you've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got aw everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell but when you smoke that rock
And suck that gut you do it oh so well

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

She's stone cold bush yea
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush yea
And that's alright with me

She's got marble eyes, sweet China doll her thighs
An animal in pain she starts to cry her pipes are open wide
She blows more than my mind echo sounds of soul
Time after time

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush
