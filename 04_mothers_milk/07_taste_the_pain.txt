Taste the Pain

Flat on my back in a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling ' cause I cannot fall
Asleep tonight, no not at all

Head lights flash across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open 'cause I cannot fall
In love with you, no not at all

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

Busted in two like a brittle stick
I cannot drink because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you and that will never do

Open my mouth I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream, you know I could not shout
It out to you and nothing to do

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye my love, a goodbye my love
I am not alive

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid, oh yeah

How the price gets paid
I got to pay the price
I think I'll walk away
[Incomprehensible]
I think I'll pay the price
