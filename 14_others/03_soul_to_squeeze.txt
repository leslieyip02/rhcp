Soul To Squeeze

I got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Is got me by my soul to squeeze
Well all the love from me
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams
Have turned to demons of greed
That's mean

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please
All that you had to free
You gotta let it be
Oh yeah

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

You're so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction

It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
I'm on a rollercoaster but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river, let me on your shore
I be coming back baby, I be coming back for more

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
Like an apple gift but i went out and never said my pleasures
I'm much better but I won't regret it never

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna keep it for the end of time
