Fortune Faded

They say at chess you've got to kill the queen
And then you've made it

Do you?

A funny thing, a king that gets himself
Assassinated

Hey now, every time I lose
Altitude

You took the town by storm
Now the mess you made is nominated

Do you?

Now put away your welcome
Soon you'll find you've overstayed it

Hey now, every time I lose
Altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while, my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of my
Wildest time, my fortune faded

To medicate this state of mind
You'll find is overrated

Do you?

You saw it all come down and now
It's time to imitate it

Hey now, every time I lose
Altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while, my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of my
Wildest time, my fortune faded

Come on god, do I seem bulletproof?

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while, my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of my
Wildest time, my fortune faded

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while, my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of my
Wildest time, my fortune faded
