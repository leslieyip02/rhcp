By The Way

Standin' in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Dani, the girl is singin' songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife
Card shark
Con job
Boot cut

Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
To get there quick
By street but not the freeway

Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play

Dogtown
Blood bath
Rib cage
Soft tail

Standin' in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Black Jack
Dope Dick
Pawn shop
Quick pick

Kiss that dyke
I know you want to hold one
Not on strike
But I'm about to bowl one

Bite that mic
I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story
So I told one

Song bird
Main line
Cash back
Hard top

Standin' in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Dani, the girl is singin' songs to me
Beneath the marquee of her soul
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya

Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh, ah

Standin' in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Dani, the girl is singin' songs to me
Beneath the marquee of her soul
By the way I tried to say
I know you from before

Standin' in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
