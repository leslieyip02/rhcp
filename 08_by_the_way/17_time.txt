Time

I was walking through a courtyard
Without shoes and without regard
Automatic catacomb
Take me where I wanna go

All around, all in phases
It astounds and amazes
Built to last and known to roam
Touch me, I'm a chromosome

One time
Fascinated by the face of time
One time
I got it to give but now I'm gonna make some time

Ultra fine and altruistic
Can't I spy into the mystic?
System's down for infiltration
Open mind free of frustration

I was driving to a safe place
And arriving as I retrace
Yelling through a telescope
Aimed it at the star of hope

One time
Fascinated by the face of time
One time
I got it to give but now I'm gonna make some time

All over the yonder
The smell of blood and thunder are
Connected by the lightening rod
Giving the beauty to it
Heaven knows how well I know you

Ultra fine and altruistic
Can't I spy into the mystic?
System's down for infiltration
Open mind free of frustration

All around, all in phases
It astounds and amazes
Built to last and known to roam
Touch me I'm a chromosome

One time
Fascinated by the face of time
One time
I got it to give but now I'm gonna make some time

All over the yonder
The smell of blood and thunder are
Connected by the lightening rod
Giving the beauty to it
Heaven knows how well I know you

Time, time, time, time, time, time
