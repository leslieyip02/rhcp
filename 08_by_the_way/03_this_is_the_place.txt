This Is the Place

This is the place where all
The junkies go
Where time gets fast
But everything gets slow

Can I get some Vaseline?
Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be
The making of a dream

I don't wanna do it
Like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it
To my baby's kid

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

This is the place where all
The devils plead
Their case to take from you
What they need

Can I isolate your gene?
Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder
If she's living in a magazine

I don't wanna say it
If it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it
But I've got to know

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

I saw you out there yesterday
What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray

I caught you out there in the fray
What did you wanna say?
A master piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray

Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean

I don't wanna take it up
With little Joe
I don't wanna fake it
But I've gotta know

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

I am a misfit
I'm born with all of it
The f*cking ultimate
Of love inside the atom split

I'm in a flash ray
A mash of DNA
Another popping Jay
Who thinks he's got something to say
