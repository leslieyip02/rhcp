Runaway

Walkin' around, out of a town, walkin' it out
When you want to, soldiering my style is smiling
Turn it into whatever I've chosen
Take me now to the water

Don't be late, I hear it gonna be so very great
And out the door, I'm a walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway

Kick it around, stare at the ground, breakin' it down
When you want to, soldiering my days I've chosen
Dancing 'round, do whatever I want to
Take me now, it's the water

Don't be late, I hear it gonna be so very great
And out the door, I'm a walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway

I think I know everything you gonna say
I think you know, don't want to runaway

Don't be late, I hear it gonna be so very great
And out the door, I'm a walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway

All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway
Out the door, I'm a walking like a runaway
