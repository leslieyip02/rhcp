Minor Thing

I change the key from C to D
You see to me, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
He knows everything

You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasin'
Cat fight intimidation

To read a mind you've got to redefine the line
To make your circle sing, y'all
He knows everything

You make a sound, the spell is bound
To come around, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
He knows everything

You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasin'
Cat fight intimidation

All out interfacing
Black star motivation
Vampire sugar junkie
Databasin' infiltration

I change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
