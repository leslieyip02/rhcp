On Mercury

I've got myself in a masochistic hold, why don't you let go
Shake it off but just to redirect my flow, come on let's go

Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middle weight
No we don't stop, or rock around the clock
Your motor mouthing off in front of every other road block

Come again and tell me what you're going through
Like a girl who only knew her child was due

Memories of everything of lemon trees on mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through

Looking up into a reverse vertigo, what an undertow
Give it up another stubborn Scorpio, come on let's go

Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middle weight
No we don't stop, or rock around the clock
Your motor mouthing off in front of every other road block

Come again and tell me what you're going through
Like a girl who only knew her child was due
To the moon she gave another good review
Turn around and look at me, it's really, really you

Memories of everything of lemon trees on mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through

Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middle weight
No we don't stop, or rock around the clock
Your motor mouthing off in front of every other road block

Memories of everything of lemon trees on mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through

Memories of everything of lemon trees on mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through
