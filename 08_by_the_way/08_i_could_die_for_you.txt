I Could Die for You

Something inside the cards
I know is right
Don't wanna live
Somebody else's life

This is what I wanna be
And this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time

I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose

I'm here to be your
Only go-between
To tell you of the sights
These eyes have seen

What I really wanna do
Is turn it into motion
Beauty that
I can't abuse

You know that I'd use my senses too
You can see that it's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then
I'd find a way to share

Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me, yo
It's all for free

I could die for you
Whatchu wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
Whatchu wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose

Come again and tell me
Where you wanna go
What it means to me
To be with you alone

Close the door and
No one has to know
How we are

Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me, yo
It's all for free

I could die for you
Whatchu wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
Whatchu wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose

Make me wanna say
I could die for you
Whatchu wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
Whatchu wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
