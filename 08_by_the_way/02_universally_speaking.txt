Universally Speaking

I saw your face, elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase, still, I so admire
Bloodshot your smile, delicate and wild
But give me she-wolf style, rip right through me

Silveretta are the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the fellin' is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Come on, baby, 'cause theres no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight

Silveretta are the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

Silveretta are the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
Nothing better,the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
Lets go
