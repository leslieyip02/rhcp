The Zephyr Song

Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of lead to bite on
What am I to fly my kite on?
Do you want to flash your light on?

Take a look its on display for you
Coming down no not today

Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's always stellar
What a way to finally smell her

Pick it up it's not to strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

Fly away on my Zephyr
I feel it more then ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together, fly on my wing

Riddlin' on liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitator
Super mainly aviator

Take a look its on display for you
Coming down no not today

Fly away on my Zephyr
I feel it more then ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

In the water where the scent of my emotion
All the world will pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, do you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, won't you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Fly away on my Zephyr
I feel it more then ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

In the water where the scent of my emotion
All the world will pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're gonna live forever

Forever
