Don't Forget Me

I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm
Make you wanna re-assume
Now, we know it all for sure

I'm a dance hall
Dirty break beat
Make the snow fall
Up from underneath your feet

Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you wanna go

I'm a meth lab, first rehab
Take it all off
And step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way

I'm the rainbow
In your jail cell
All the memories of
Everything you've ever smelled

Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
Ooh

Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
(Don't forget me, I can't hide it)
(Come again, get me excited)

I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread
Inside the tool shed
Now, we know it all for sure

I could show you
To the free field
Overcome and more
Will always be revealed

Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you wanna go
Ooh

Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
(Don't forget me, I can't hide it)
(Come again, get me excited, ooh)

Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
(Don't forget me, I can't hide it)
(Never met now, let me light it)

I'm the bloodstain
On your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now, we know it all for sure

Make the hair stand
Up on your arm
Teach you how to dance
Inside the funny farm

Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you wanna go

I'll be there but
Tell me when you wanna go
Come again and
Tell me when you wanna go

More will be revealed my friend
