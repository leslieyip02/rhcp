We Believe

The curtain is open a head to put dope in
Now we will come clean it the future we've seen it
No, no, I know, I said, no no

It's like a dream that falls away
Into the night where we can play
I'm on a train one happy day
Two eyes for sight three times I pray

Soda pop we've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes we've got a pressure drop
We don't know but every day I go
To see what I can bring into a cameo, oh oh, oh no

We believe, we believe

Climb a tree for monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a quaker

The mission, the method
The downfall arrested
'Cause it's not the first time
Nor is it the worst time, no no, oh no

To see the bird without a care
For in a word it's nice out there
In a tree my mama bear
Will be all right with proper care
Hey hey, hey

Boomerang into a bigger bang
A little cry of love because they cannot sing
Cherokee, what did the pharaoh see?
Another time and space another place to be

We believe, we believe
We believe, we believe

Climb a tree for monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a quaker

Climb a tree for monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a quaker

The motive, the measure
The purpose, the pleasure
The risk, is it worth it?
The disc, is it perfect?

I found you amongst them
The flower with young stem
Disparage, the broken
The marriage, elopin'
