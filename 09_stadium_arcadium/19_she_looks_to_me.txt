She Looks to Me

Looks to me like heaven sent
No lullaby kid, no five percent
Anyway you want to cut that cake
She's dyin' from the likes of abandonment

Lost in the valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold

It looked to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looked to me, all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me, she looked to me, all right

It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in, it's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn a way too much
Shootin' dope in the back of a Cadillac Jack

Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold

It looked to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me, she looks to me, alright

Down in the South seas
Give me your mouth please
Resuscitation
Is the way I found these

I give you major
You give me minor
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner, now

Lost in the valley without my horses
No one can tell me what my remorse is
God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold

She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

It looks to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me, she looks to me
