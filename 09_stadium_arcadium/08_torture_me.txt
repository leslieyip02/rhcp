Torture Me

Because I'm happy to be sad
I want it all, I want it bad
Oh, oh, it's what I know

A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
Let's go oh, it's what I know

Torture me and torture me
Forcin' me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me, so torture me, please

All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go oh, it's what I know

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me, so torture me, please

The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill, let's go
Let's turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound is so

But all the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around, let's go
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near, it's so, ooh

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please
