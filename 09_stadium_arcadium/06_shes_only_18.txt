She's Only 18

She's only 18, don't like the Rolling Stones
She took a short cut to being fully grown
She's got that mood ring, a little sister rose
A smell of Springsteen, a pair of pantyhose

This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette
She said, "My man you know it's time to get your fingers wet"
Your hustle's busted when you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you when you were screaming, "Handle it"

Knock the world right off its feet and straight onto its head
Book of love, will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shed

I heard some P-Funk out on the road again
To get your head shrunk is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline, a perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine, I'm gonna make you mine

It's understood you wrap your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your titty at the discotheque
I put my lovin' in your oven not a head to check
The last I heard from you when you were screaming, "Resurrect"

Knock the world right off its feet and straight onto its head
Book of love, will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shed

Knock the world right off its feet and straight onto its head
Book of love, will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shed
