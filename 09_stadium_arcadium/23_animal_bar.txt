Animal Bar

Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I I I, the cry of isolation
I I I, the high of meditation
I I I, the sweet percipitation
I I I, the high of deprivation

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken

In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One two three let's make this
Runnin' through the mud I gotta feeling of worth
One two three forsake this

All aboard the ship 'cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down you'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the stain and I'm a little older
Right as the rain at the animal bar

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I I I, the cry of isolation
I I I, the high of meditation
I I I, the mild percipitation
I I I, the high of deprivation

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken

In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One two three let's make this
Runnin' through the mud I gotta feeling of worth
One two three forsake this

Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water saving us from the heat

Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
And fire will come find its day
The water the water the water washing it all away

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken

In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One two three let's make this
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One two three forsake this

In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One two three let's make this
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One two three forsake this
