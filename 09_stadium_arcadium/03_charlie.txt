Charlie

Hu

All aboard stitch in time
Get yours, I got mine
In a minute I'll be there
Sit tight, get square

You could do at the hippodrome
Slide back, trombone
Anybody got a TV tome
That's right, unknown

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little women save me some
Better get up on your run

Hu

So much more than, Charlie's waking me
To my core and Charlie's shaking me
Tell my story, Charlie's making me
An' Charlie's making me smile, whoa hoa, now

Tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
Wu wu wu wu wu wu dor
Wake wake wake wake wake wake wake
Wu wu wu wu wu wu wor

Everybody do the twist
Get the the message off flea's fists
Move around like a scientist
Lay down, get kissed

Big picture and it never lies
Big daddy, will advise
Eveready in disguise
Sunset, sunrise

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little women save me some
Better get up on your run

Hu

So much more than, Charlie's waking me
To my core and Charlie's shaking me
Tell my story, Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile, whoa oah, now

My heart, your skin this love, I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong, be free belong
Intimate sight has come into light

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little women save me some
Better get up on your run

All I ever wanted to
Was pick it up and run with you
Slip it into a summer spell
Double up and run like hell

Hu

So much more that, Charlie's waking me
To my core and Charlie's shaking me
Tell my story, Charlie's making me
An' Charlie's making me smile, woah oah, now

My heart, your skin this love, I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong, be free belong
Intimate sight has come into light

My heart, your skin this love, I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong, be free belong
Intimate sight has come into light
