C'mon Girl

Everything inside of me
Is burning up for you to see
And if we should get into it
A two way kind of syndicate, hold me

Compare us to a Ferris wheel
Just be sure what you wanna steal
Some people do it by the book
But I prefer to go by feel, tell me

I wanted to get outta here
But every time I reappear
Now I have the words my dear
To whisper right into your ear, hey, yeah

C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right

C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right

The spirit of a dragon's tear
Is lovely at this time of year
The cave within your mountainside
Is deeper than than it will be wide, hold me

My disenchanted diplomat
Asleep inside the laundromat
Conveyer belts are moving and
I want you to be sure of that, tell me

And if you let it germinate
I know it will be worth the wait
Disputed by the news that it was you
Who tried to instigate, hey

C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right

C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right

Blessed are the hypocrites
Outwitted but she never quits
The trouble with a band of slits
Is washing off the muddy bits, hey yeah

C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right

C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right

Oh yeah
She's with me and I'm your man
If I can't find you no one can
