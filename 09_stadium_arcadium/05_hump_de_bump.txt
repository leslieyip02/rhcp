Hump De Bump

Forty detectives this week
Forty detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down Love Street
Strollin' is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependent

Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bap
Hump de bump doop bodu

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bap
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump bump

Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now

Workin' the beat as we speak
Working the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependant

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bap
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump bump, c'mon

Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now

Bump bump

Listen to me what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance
And a chance to make out

Livin' in a citadel
It's hot enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll
And I am wide awake now

Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now
