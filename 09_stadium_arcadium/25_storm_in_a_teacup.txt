Storm in a Teacup

Oh, good God, Heaven Almighty, Heaven's to murder Troy
We've got a cataclysmic situation developing
Someone get down here now

Come on, come on, baby let me show you what I'm talking about
You try to be a lady but your walking like a sour kraut
Looka looka like-a like-a likuh you wanna get some
If you never tell a lie then you never have to play dumb

Pretty baby, time is gonna take some
Pretty baby love is gonna make some
Little lady hearts are gonna break some
Kinda shady tears your gonna make some

Dirty baby gotta situation
Pretty baby open invitation
Little lady what a rep*tation
Kinda shady, how you gonna make again

I know you can't straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
I know you can't battle the masses dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl

Oh no, oh no, it's getting worse, worse by the minute
We're down here in division in mystery
Someone send for back up

Every other day you say your gonna have to bury 'em
Famous last words from the Laysarium
You say you sent a record saying something 'bout my love
You can take the A train but your gonna have to lie low

I know you can't straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl, yeah
I know you can't battle the masses dear
A tiny storm in your teacup girl

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Pretty baby, time is gonna take some
Pretty baby love is gonna make some
Little lady hearts is gonna break some
Kinda shady tears your gonna make some

Pretty baby gotta situation
Pretty baby open invitation
Little lady what a rep*tation
Kinda shady how you wanna make again

I know you can't straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know we may never get outta here
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
