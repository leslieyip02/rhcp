Strip My Mind

Oh yeah, oh oh yeah

Arthur J. did indicated
The boulevard would never be
So full of love and life again
(Yeah)
I'm sick of all your whistling

Hot as Hades, early eighties
Sing another song and make me
Feel like I'm in love again
(Yeah)
I lose the way I am

Oh yeah
Oh

Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind

Oh yeah, oh oh yeah

All in favor sign the waiver
Bloody Carolina won't you
Take another look inside?
(Yeah)
It will make you cry

Operator, co-creator
Come on radiator won't you
Blow another top and sing?
(Yeah)
You only get what you dream

Oh yeah
Oh

Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind

El Dorado won the lotto
All that cash and not a clue
But now you know what I've been through
(Yeah)

Oh yeah
Oh

Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
