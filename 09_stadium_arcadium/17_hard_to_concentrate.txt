Hard to Concentrate

Hustle, bustle and so much muscle
Cells about to separate, oh
And I find it hard to concentrate

And temporary, this cash and carry
I'm stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate and

All I want is for you to be happy
And take this moment to make you my family
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found

Death defying, this mess I'm buying
It's raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate

And estuary is blessed but scary, oh
Heart's about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate

And one to treasure the rest of your days here
And give you pleasure in so many ways, dear
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found

Here we go

Do you want me to show up for duty
And serve this woman and honor her beauty?
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found yourself with me

Will you agree to take this man into your world
And now we are as one

My lone ranger the heat exchanger
Is living in this figure 8
And I'll do my best to recreate

Sweet precision and soft collision, oh
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate

And all I want is for you to be happy
And take this woman and make you my family
And finally you have found someone perfect
And finally you have found

All I want is for you to be happy
And take this woman and make you my family
And finally you have found someone perfect
And finally you have found yourself
