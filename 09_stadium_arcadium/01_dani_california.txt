Dani California

Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Condemned everywhere sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess I'm your priest
Yeah, Yeah

She's a lover, baby and a fighter
She should've seen it comin when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya'
A little loaded she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess I'm your priest
Yeah, Yeah

Who knew the harder side of you
Who knew what all this got to prove
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true too sad sad sad

First to fade her, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it, up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Down in the badlands she was saving the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess I'm your priest
