The Heavy Wing

Golden light streamin' from your eyes
Give me a piece of the real thing
And I live with you this life
Stripped and clean, a restless wolverine
An eloquent part of the whole dance
And I stray

Tell the whole world to slow down
We gotta get off and we gotta go 'round
Tell the whole world to roll down
The window is broken, forever unspoken
Only whenever

Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for everything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantries
The memory
Chemistry

Death to rise, subtraction of advice
The criminal ties of my rival
And I'll roll these dice
Cold supply, scraping to get by
Blatantly flooding the low rise
And I'll throw this dice

Trace me now through your innocence
Tell me it's part of the program I started
Space me now through your citizens
Tell me it's part of the whole plan now
Bringing my slow hand

Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for everything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantries
The memory
A chemistry

Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for everything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantries
The memory
A chemistry
