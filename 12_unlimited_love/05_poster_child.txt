Poster Child

Melle Mel and Richard Hell were dancing at the Taco Bell
When someone heard a rebel yell, I think it was an infidel
Adam Ant and Robert Plant were center of a sycophant

And used to buy Ulysses Grant to record at the Record Plant
Islamabad is on the nod, Havana at the riot squad
And if you want to be a Mod, you'll have to meet me at the quad

You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note

Parliament's Atomic Dog that hats were filling up with fog
A talk about the life and death of every penny analog
The seventies were such a win, singing the Led Zeppelin
Lizzy lookin' mighty thin, the Thompson's had another twin

I thought I won the lottery, the numbers never thought of me
Ramones had a lobotomy, so spin me like a pottery

I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight, ow
La da da da, bum bum ba dum

A funky piece, the Sandinista, me and minor Mona Lisa
Judas Priest has whipped the beast, the mother love was named Teresa
Bubble gum, I come bazooka, dirty dandy nanda loop
A smoke banana in your hookah, now I know the band Ruca
Bernie Mac and Caddyshack were dusty as the bric-a-brac

And if you ask me for the time, I'll tell you that the future's back

You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note

Steve Miller and Duran Duran, the Joker dancing in the sand
Van Morrison, the Astral man, the festival of hurricanes
Speak of Chico and the Man, the silence of a certain lamb
MC5 kick out the jam, a poncho full of contraband
Dairy Queen was on the scene on every preteen magazine
The Motorhead and mystic queen, I must've needed Valvoline

I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La da da da, bum bum ba dum

You got me on this
Well, then I can't get off
With no one else but you
You turn me on too
Well, then I can't get up, ooh
For no one else but you

Creem magazine, A Love Supreme, the ballad of a Billie Jean
And now we know the Status Quo, but God would never save the Queen
Dave Mushegain, Copenhagen, copper goose of Ronald Reagan
Dollar savers, Flavor Flav the cosmic moves are power saving
And my fist a double kissed unlisted number purplemist
The Chubby Checker do the twist, and everyone's a narcissist

You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note

The waterbed was takin' meds, a beaver with the house of red
A fatty for the natty dread, a pocket full of Talking Heads
M.I.A.'s making paper planes, addiction to the ways of Janes
My stuff is made of purple rain, ten fingers in the lion's mane
Giant squid, Karate Kid, Sid Vicious in the Katie-did
The planet that we must forbid, the English speakers in Madrid

I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La da da da, bum bum ba dum
I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La da da da, bum bum ba dum
