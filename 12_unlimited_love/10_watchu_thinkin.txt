Whatchu Thinkin'

I got no reason to believe
Just a theory that we do appease
I don't know what you want from me
Where you go to get your ecstasy
Start tapping rhythm from the source
Maybe I could be your Crazy Horse
We only wanted to be
We only wanted to be sure
What is it for?
Come get me
We only wanted to be
We only wanted to be

What you thinkin'?
Got more than enough for you, yeah
Over and over and over again, well
Over and over until it sends
What you thinkin'?
White buffalo be drinkin' dirty
Over and over and over again, well
Over and over with all my friends

I think the two of us should go
For a drive, like maybe Idaho
Road trip circuits just around the bend
I could be your beneficial friend
Call me every name in the book
Punk-ass fascist and a dirty crook
We only wanted to be
We only wanted to be sure
What is it for?
Come get me
We only wanted to be
We only wanted to be

What you thinkin'?
Got more than enough for you, yeah
Over and over and over again, yeah
Over and over until it sends
What you thinkin'?
White buffalo be drinkin' dirty
Over and over and over again now
Over and over with all my friends

I got these things in mind, you know
South Dakota, show the buffalo
In the Black Hills you could find it all
Blood runs thick like from a waterfall
This broken native entity
Dreaming clean-up on the century
This horse is crazy not to be
This horse is crazy

What you thinkin'?
Got more than enough for you, well
Over and over and over again, yeah
Over and over until it sends
What you thinkin'?
White buffalo be drinkin' dirty
Over and over and over again now
Over and over with all my friends
