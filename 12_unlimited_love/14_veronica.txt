Veronica

My name is Veronica
I come from the South Side of Chicago
Remember my raincoat
We love you the same way, and
My life is a rope swing
Always heading back to from where I came
Got no need to blame you

Danger, danger
Everyone goes for a ride
Danger, danger
Everyone loses their mind

My name is Nebraska
I live in a matchbox of Omaha
It's nothin' fantastic
We love you the same way, and
You call me Maria
My life on the North Side of Miami
I might come and see ya

Danger, danger
Everyone goes for a ride
Danger, danger
Everyone loses their mind

My name is, "I Love You"
I come from the same place as everyone
Just lucky to be here
We love you the same way, and
This heart is relentless
I love you the most when you're down and out
Please come to my senses
'Cause we all play the same game

Danger, danger
Everyone goes for a ride
Danger, danger
Everyone loses their mind

Been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time since I took you, my toll
Been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time since I took you, my soul
I don't want it to be broken up
I don't want it to be without love

This is the end
My passionate friend
My passionate friend
I send my love from, now
This is the end
My passionate friend
My passionate friend
Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I don't want it to be broken up) been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time since I took you, my soul
(I don't want it to be without love) been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time, yeah
