These Are the Ways

Make me a fist
Purple Mountain road that I can't miss
Have we all had enough?
Have we all had too much?
Lost in a dream
Please step down from your bully machine
Can we all back it up?
Can we all give it up?

These are the ways when you come from America
The sights, the sounds, the smells
These are the ways when you come from America
I don't wanna die and she's gonna take good care of ya
I just wanna thrive and there's gonna be hysteria

Don't be late
Walk us through the golden gate, yeah
Bruce and George
Singing for their own reward

Take me inside
Twenty-three windows and it's gonna be a long ride
All had enough?
Have we all had too much?
Sing me the blues
Cowgirl's tight in her basketball shoes
Can we all back it up?
Can we all give it up?

These are the ways when you come from America
