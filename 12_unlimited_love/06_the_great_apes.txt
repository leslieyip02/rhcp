The Great Apes

She's a box car rollin' by
Like a black star in the sky
She's a failure once or twice
Like a trailer spinnin' out upon dizzy ice

Flowers fly when we grow old
Snakes get high, or so I'm told
She's an eagle out on the road
Like my favorite Beatle everyone bought and sold

All my love and half my kisses
Superstar don't do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free

She's a rain bird on the prowl
Like an urge to be yourself that you won't allow
She's a forest that we burned
Just a blueprint for a life that we never learned

Flowers fly when we grow old
Snakes get high, or so I'm told
She's a lynch mob on the street
Take another step and I will kill the beat

All my love and half my kisses
Superstar don't do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free

She's a bus stop, glockenspiel
She's a simulation life that you thought was real
She's an image that we blurred
It's a pixelated panther, now let it purr

All my love and half my kisses
Superstar don't do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free

I just want the great apes to be free
I just want the great apes to be free
