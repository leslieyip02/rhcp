White Braids & Pillow Chair

I'm a tangled tiger and I wanna rip it all to shreds
So I can ask it why
She's a loaded cobra and she wanted to be with me for the ride
In a Sunday diner, I'm reminded there's no finer place to kiss
Than one like this

But babe, I can see what's right with you
White braids and pillow chair
I could spend my nights with you
This pussy willow
Babe, I can see all sides of you
White braids and pillow chair
I don't know what I would do without your pillow

She's a Bobby Darin singing to the fish and herring sacrifice
Oh, that's her knife
There's a Karmann Ghiah parked out back and we believe it is alive, oh
You can see the river running through my devastated concrete eyes
They don't deny

But babe, I can see what's right with you
White braids and pillow chair
I could spend my nights with you
This pussy willow
Babe, I can see all sides of you
White braids and pillow chair
I don't know what I would do

California blue
Sing to you things to do
California blue
Sing to you
Deep Ventura sky
Rolling by, rolling why
Deep Ventura sky
Rolling by
Santa Cruz in June
Either blue, surf the moon
Santa Cruz in June
Surf the moon
San Francisco Bay
Safe to say, paved the way
San Francisco Bay
Paved the way
