Tangelo

When I'm with you, I feel like myself
No stranger, the shadow of somebody else
When I feel you holding my hand
I get touched, ain't this life grand?

But the form of a life is long never ending
And the smell of your hello, I know
And the smile of a knife is seldom befriending
And the smell of tangelo, I know

When I'm near you, I feel like a king
A life force inside to do anything
When I'm downtown, I pick up the phone
I hear you and I'm not alone

But the form of a life is long never ending
And the smell of your hello, I know
And the smile of a knife is seldom befriending
And the smell of tangelo, I know

But December came strong, the mending went wrong
And the clothes on the line never dried
And the crows on my hill came in for the kill
But the dream of this love never died

When I lost you out in that field
My crooked eyes could hardly conceal
Tell me one time and bring me my tray
Oh, let it go and now I must pray
Let's pray
