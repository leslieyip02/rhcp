Bastards Of Light

Anything at all
Anything and I will find you
Anything at all
Can I be your first brawl?

Everyone that's there is someone
Everyone that's here is someone
Everyone, I swear, is someone's daughter

And it feels so good upon a Saturday night
When the bastards come to fight
And it won't be long before they carry me home
I'm the bastard of your light

When it's said and done
Meet me at the old meat market
When it's said and done
Can I please make you come?

Everyone that goes is someone
Everyone that throws is someone
Everyone that knows it's in the water

And it feels so good upon a Saturday night
When the bastards come to fight
And it won't be long before they carry me home
I'm the bastard of your light
And it feels so fine to know my shattering bones
When it's all those lefts and rights
And it won't be long before I'm buried alone
I'm the bastard of your light

I'll decorate your face
It's time to get it on
How does that crimson taste?
What, what, what, what?
It's time to bob and weave
You gotta move your feet
It's an honor to receive
Tomato cans on tap
Another dandy chap
How 'bout a canvas nap?
One, two, three, four

And it feels so good upon a Saturday night
When the bastards come to fight
And it won't be long before they carry me home
I'm the bastard of your light
And it feels so good upon a Saturday night
When the bastards come to fight
And it won't be long before they carry me home
I'm the bastard of your light
