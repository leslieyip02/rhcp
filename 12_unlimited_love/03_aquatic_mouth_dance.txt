Aquatic Mouth Dance

Lookin' back at the years gone by
When The Message changed my life
Heavy metal, the nest was dead
Well, and the rappers gave delight
But I don’t know who
Was looking out for anyone like me and you
A-maybe it was Siouxsie Sioux

Day to day was the way we play
Well, everybody needs to eat
Girl is gone and the front door too
Well, I guess we move our feet
And I don't know why
The color of your eyes was stolen from the sky
And earthquakеs never need to lie
Aquatic mouth dancе is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you now
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you

Everyone and their best friend knew
That the west was overdue
Growin' out of the fertile dirt
Well, and the cracks were fallin’ through
But I don't know what I'm looking for
I only know the deepest cut
It's coming from my gut

Parking lot of the old Starwood
Where the Misfits like to go
Billy Zoom and his silver string
Well, it just might be John Doe
Well, I don't know where
I'm gonna sleep tonight
Please tell me, can you spare
A pillow for my head and hair?

Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you now
Now's here, my love
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you now

Pucker up for the hologram
I better find out who I am
Let it out with a downtown scream
Because we need more space to jam
But I don't know how
To turn it down, I end up being so damn loud
Ah, bend your brow, ah, bend it now

Prototopical Sunday nights
Smog flowers, they don’t bite
Dirty skies never worked so hard
Better step to the Angels Flight
And I don’t know if
The embers of my burning flame
Are from this spliff
The greatest gift, the greatest gift

Peppered up at the Cathay bash
And with a forty-five to split
Spillin' beer was a good fountain
Like the milk from a mother’s tits
But I don't know slow
Someone has to come and teach me self-control
Or should I just say "Fuck it" and we go?
(That was pretty good)
