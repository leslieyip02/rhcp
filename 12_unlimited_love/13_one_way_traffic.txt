One Way Traffic

Come from the sun in San Marino
Guess that makes me Angeleno
Friends got married, had them dogs
Now they read those catalogues
This commerce makes me nauseous
When did life get so damn cautious?
So I drive in search of smiles
XM on, let's check out Miles

This slice of life when you're out on the road
Is always extra nice when there's someone to hold

Ayo, ayo
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ayo, ayo
Spirographic anagram
Ayo, ayo
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ayo, ayo
Would you be mine?

Anyway, I was headed south
Taste of coffee in my mouth
Up that off-ramp 405
Angry drivers on both sides
Got a call from my good friend Dave
He said, "Yo, let's get that wave"
I said, "Yes, just tell me where"
Board's up top, wind in my hair
From the mind of Frida Kahlo
Show me love and I will follow
From the words of my old man
Conversations in the sand

This slice of life when you're out on the road
Is always extra nice when there's someone to hold

Ayo, ayo
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ayo, ayo
Spirographic anagram
Ayo, ayo
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ayo, ayo
Would you be mine?

I got a slice of life that's built for you
Oh, now, come and give me something to spread my bread onto
Time and time again, we get a window and a clue
Time and time again, life-changing rendezvous

Anyway, made a left on third
Got distracted, jumped that curb
Unaware and on her walk
I hit the brakes, made time to talk
She said, "Can I get that ride?"
Oh my God, just get inside
It was all that I imagined
Born to ride, enthusiasm
Packed our bags and headed west
PCH, I'm so impressed
My friends said, "Having fun yet?"
We drove off into the sunset

This slice of life when you're out on the road
Is always extra nice when there's someone to hold

Ayo, ayo
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ayo, ayo
Spirographic anagram
Ayo, ayo
Would you be my traffic ma'am?
Ayo, ayo
Would you be mine?

Would you be mine?
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine? (You know, woo)
