Black Summer

A lazy rain am I
The skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon

A sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
(hear me now)

Platypus are a few
The secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew
(Get it on)

My crater weighs a ton
The archer's on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun

It's been a long time since I made a new friеnd
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long timе and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end

Back the flaming whip
Are sailin' on our censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip

Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end

I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
