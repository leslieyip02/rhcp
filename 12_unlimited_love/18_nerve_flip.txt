Nerve Flip

Back at the London dairy
We drank it all too soon
We drank to dysentery
Numb to the pain, everybody rain

Got high on pink flamingos
Santo will take a charge
A list of long Domingos
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Come kiss that circuit breaker
An image to enlarge
Let's celebrate the quaker
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time for the grind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time for the grind
Nerve flip

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The pain of growing younger
Big balding of a tirе
The blitz and all its hunger
Electrical firе, standing on a wire
Song five for Curtis Mayfield
This dancing's so alive
The onion never stays peeled
Everybody move, everybody glide

Stab me with colored pencils
Backseat and butterflies
A song for flesh utensils
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I've been adjudicated
The court of social flaws
Some other dude she dated
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time for the grind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time for the grind

Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Nerve flip
