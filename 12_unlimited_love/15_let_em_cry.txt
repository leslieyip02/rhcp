Let 'Em Cry

Cry, cry, let 'em cry
We don't need no reason why
I'ma touch you up with every loving rough emotion
Cry, cry, let 'em cry
Bleeding from my restless eye
Our laws are breaking
And no physics can define us
Tell my wife and dog
I'll be home at 3 AM
To kiss you in the mornin'
Cry, cry, let 'em cry
Know what I have deep inside
It's time to break free from the mouse trap when it's storming

Up, up the lover, we got the mother
Touch up the neighbor, she don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Nirvana
All I know is I feel fine
Up, up another, we got the cover
Touch up the Raiders, they don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Madonna
All I know is I feel fine

Shine, shine, let' em shine
Hit me with that lion's prize
Ten thousand heavens are about to shed their glory
Shine, shine, let 'em shine
Hit me with that Guggenheim
I'ma tell you everything and how to build a story
Trust in love, my man
You can feel it raining down so early when it's forming
Slide, slide, let it slide
My street is preoccupied
I'd like to kiss her face if I could only find her

Up, up the lover, we got the mother
Touch up the neighbor, she don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Nirvana
All I know is I feel fine
Up, up another, we got the cover
Touch up the Raiders, they don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Madonna
All I know is I feel fine

Cry, cry, let 'em cry
We don't need no reason why
I'ma touch you up with every loving rough emotion
Cry, cry, let 'em cry
Bleeding from my lefty eye
Our laws are breaking and no physics can define us

Up, up the lover, we got the mother
Touch up the neighbor, she don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Nirvana
All I know is I feel fine
Up, up another, we got the cover
Touch up the Raiders, they don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Madonna
All I know is I feel fine
