Lovin' and Touchin'

Loving and touching and
Laughing and squeezing and
Walking and joking and
Smiling and teasing

Loving and kissing and
Rubbing and scrubbing and
Styling and slumming and
Rolling and cumming

I'll hold you a lifetime
I'll love you forever
I'll make you my wife and
I'll never forget you

I'll give you my smile
On the face of your child
I will give you my love
I will give you my love

Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and love
