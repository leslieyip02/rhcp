Hollywood (Africa)

Take me back, hold my hand
All the way back to the brother land
Take me back, I want to go back

Take me back and my funky ass band
All the way back to the brother land
Take me back

I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brother land
Now children, Hollywood

I want to get up and go with my funky ass jams
All the way back to the brother land
Take me back, I want to go back

Hollywood

Where the women is the women
And the man is the man

I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brother land
Now children
