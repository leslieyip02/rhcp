Yertle The Turtle

Look at the turtle go, bro

On a far away island of Salamasond
I said, Yertle the turtle was king of the pond
A nice little pond, it was clean, it was neat
The water was warm, there was a plenty to eat

Until one day, the king of them all
Decided the kingdom he ruled, was too small
â€½I'm a ruler of all that I see but I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with meâ€

â€½With this stone for a throne, I'm too low down
I cannot look down upon the places beyondâ€
So Yertle the turtle king lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king gave a command

He ordered all the turtles onto one another's back
He piled them high into a ten turtle stack
"Oh, Yertle the turtle, the things I now rule
I'm king of a cow, I'm king of a mule"

Look at the turtle go, bro

Then down from below in the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne, this burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said, "I beg your pardon, King Yertle"

â€½I've pains in my back, my shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand here, Your Majestyâ€
"Silence", the king of the turtles barked back
To the bad burpin' little turtle named Mack
â€½I'm Yertle the turtle, oh marvelous me
For I am ruler of all that I seeâ€

Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
