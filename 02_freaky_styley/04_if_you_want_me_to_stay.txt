If You Want Me to Stay

If you want me to stay, I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there, then you'll know
For me to stay here, I've got to be me

You'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days, I'm gone, forget you reachin' me by phone
'Cause I promise, I'll be gone for a while

And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person, that you really are now
You got to get it straight, how could I ever be late
When you're my woman, taking up my time

Oh, how could I ever allow, I guess, I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
But when you know that, you're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one

I'll be good
(I'll be good)
I wish I could
(I wish I could)
Get this message over to you, now
(This message over to you, now)

And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person, that you really are now
I'll be so good, I wish, I could
Get this message over to you now

Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good, I wish, I could
