Freaky Styley

I f*ck 'em, just to see the look on their face
I f*ck 'em, just to see the look on their face
I f*ck 'em, just to see the look on their face

I say it out loud
I'm freaky styley
And I'm proud

I say it out loud
I'm freaky styley
And I'm proud

I say it out loud
I'm freaky styley
And I'm proud

I f*ck 'em, just to see the look on their face
I f*ck 'em, just to see the look on their face
I f*ck 'em, just to see the look on their face

I'm freaky styley
And I'm proud
