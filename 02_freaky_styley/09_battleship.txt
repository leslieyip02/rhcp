Battleship

Three miles off the coast of Beirut
New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise, yeah

Battleship, battleship

Now see the sailor boys dressed in blue
Cheer the change to make the news
Send the shell down the spiral groove
Bombs away it's a shakedown cruise, yeah

Battleship, battleship

Three miles off the coast of Beirut
New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise, yeah

Battleship, battleship
