Sex Rap

Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're gonna get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move

We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum, kissum, kissum

In the mind is one design to make you feel fine
Suckin' on mine with a sixty-nine
I'm inclined to f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Push it on in and pull it on out
I pump that lemon till it pouts

Sex rap, sex
Sex rap, sex

Open your legs to the sensual sound
With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hug the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down

Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it, gettin' it, gettin' it good

Sex rap, sex
Sex rap, sex

In my head, as a hellified hum
I take to rubbin' her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb, I strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like, ooh, how rum

Well, I like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make cum, make cum, cum
