American Ghost Dance

Give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death
Of a race is a game

Where seldom is heard
A peaceable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came

Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an Indian Chief

There is a secret I keep
It's called 'The Talking Leaf'
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs

Like a rock that bleeds
In a sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks
Of a wounded knee creek

Today a new man
Who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains

â€½I'm aliveâ€, he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave

There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched

But the burning flame
It turns to burning pain
A genuine genocide
And that's truly insane

So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved
